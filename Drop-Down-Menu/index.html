    Description: 
      - Document Structure: 
        - <!DOCTYPE html> declares the document type and HTML version (HTML5).
        - <html lang="en"> is the root element of the page and specifies the 
          language as English.
        - The <head> section includes metadata, the page title, and a link to 
          an external CSS file for styling.
      - Metadata:
        - <meta charset="UTF-8"> sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which 
          includes most characters from all known languages.
        - <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> tells Internet 
          Explorer to use the latest rendering engine.
        - <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
          ensures the page is responsive and scales properly on different devices.
      - Page Title:
        - <title>Drop Down Menu</title> sets the title of the webpage, which 
          appears in the browser tab.
      - External Resources:
        - <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"> links an external CSS 
          file located in a css directory for styling the HTML elements.
      - Body Content:
        - The <body> contains the visible content of the HTML document.
        - A div with the class hero probably serves as a prominent section of 
          the page, such as a banner or introductory section.
        - Inside the hero div, there's another div with the class 
          primary-navigation-selector, which likely serves as a container for 
          the dropdown menu.
      - Dropdown Menu:
        - A div with the ID primary-navigation-selectColor contains a 
          paragraph (<p>) with the ID selectText and an image (<img>) with the 
          ID arrowIcon. The paragraph displays the default text for the 
          dropdown menu, and the image is probably used as a visual indicator 
          (like a downward arrow) to signify that it's a dropdown menu.
        - A ul element with the ID list and class hide represents the dropdown 
          list that is initially hidden (as suggested by the class name). This 
          list contains multiple li elements with the class options, each 
          representing a different color option. Some list items have a 
          label with a class swatch, which might be used to display a color 
          sample.
      - JavaScript Functionality:
        - <script src="js/script.js"></script> links an external JavaScript 
          file that contains the logic to handle the dropdown behavior. This 
          script likely handles click events on the dropdown menu to toggle 
          the visibility of the list and change the text of the selected item, 
          as well as rotate the arrow icon to indicate the menu's open or 
          closed state.
